<h1>Tour of Heroes</h1>

<p>The Tour of Heroes application that you build helps a staffing agency manage its stable of heroes. The application has many of the features that you'd expect to find in any data-driven application.</p>

### This tutorial helps you gain confidence that Angular can do whatever you need it to do by showing you how to:

* [x] Use Angular directives to show and hide elements and display lists of hero data.
* [x] Create Angular components to display hero details and show an array of heroes.
* [x] Use one-way data binding for read-only data.
* [x] Add editable fields to update a model with two-way data binding.
* [x] Bind component methods to user events, like keystrokes and clicks.
* [x] Enable users to select a hero from a list and edit that hero in the details view.
* [x] Format data with pipes.
* [x] Create a shared service to assemble the heroes.
* [x] Use routing to navigate among different views and their components.
